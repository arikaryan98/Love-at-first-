                <h2>How it all Began</h2>
                <P>
                        Hey y’all!
                        After spending countless hours wondering what the hell I should write about, I realized that I should first introduce myself.  Hello, my name is Arika (pronounced Erica), and welcome to my blog! I am a second year at The Ohio State University pursing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in Marketing. A lot of my interest lies with digital media and graphic design.
                        When I first pondered the idea of writing a blog, it seemed extremely abstract. The longer I waited, the more I realized that I had no choice but to start Love at First Write. Writing has always been such a passion of mine, but I just recently discovered that it’s so much more than that. In August of 2018, my boyfriend left to go to basic training for the Air Force. For two months the only communication that existed between us was through writing letters. Not only did my relationship with my boyfriend grow so much stronger, but so did my relationship with myself. I had never felt more fulfilled and at ease.
                        Growing up, writing came so naturally to me. I tried to journal because I saw that it made others feel so happy, but it never seemed to work for me. However, with writing letters I was able to capture so many raw emotions. I fell into a routine of immediately writing about my experiences whether I was excited, frustrated, stressed, happy, surprised or proud of myself. With no other form of communication, I was able to reveal so much of myself in such a poised way. The most rewarding part of that experience was opening my mailbox to find yet another response to my letters. It filled my heart to know that someone was reading and appreciating the things I wrote, I fell in love at first write. 
                        Before starting this blog, I had never read another blog before, I had done no research and I hadn’t searched for any inspiration. I want to portray the rawest of emotions with no preconceived notions of what that’s supposed to look like. I created this blog in hopes to inspire, educate and relate to you. I am beyond excited to bring you along for my countless adventures. Thank you so much for supporting.
                        Xoxo,
                        Arika
                        
                </P>
